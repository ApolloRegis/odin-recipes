        <h2> Steps </h2>
          <ol>
            <li> 
              <p> Melt butter and oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
                  Add mushrooms, season </p>
              <p> with salt, and saute, stirring
                  occasionally, until they turn golden brown, 5 to 10 </p>
              <p> minutes. Add onion and ground beef. Cook, stirring,
                  until meat is browned and </p> 
              <p> crumbly, and onions turn soft
                  and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with </p>
              <p> black pepper and cayenne. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Stir in minced garlic and flour, and cook for 1 minute.
                  Pour in vodka and allow to </p> 
              <p> evaporate, about 30 seconds. Stir in beef broth and
                  water and bring to a simmer. </p>
              <p> Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Reduce heat to medium, and mix in noodles. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and </p>
              <p> simmer for 5 minutes. Uncover and stir thoroughly. Cover again and cook until </p>
              <p> noodles are just tender, about 3 minutes. (See Cook's Note.) </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Once noodles are cooked, reduce heat to low, and stir in sour cream. Serve </p> 
              <p> immediately with additional sour cream and green onions or chives if so </p> 
              <p> desired. </p>
            </li>
