          <p> This Persian rice takes the grand prize. I believe I've posted
            a few foolproof </p>
          <p> methods for cooking perfect rice, but this recipe is not even
            close to second. The </p>
          <p> beauty of this method is that it doesn't rely on any specific
            measurements or </p>
          <p> exact times. This will make some of you very nervous but just
            go with it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li> 3 quarts water </li>

            <li> 3 tablespoons kosher salt </li>
                
            <li> 2 cups basmati rice, rinsed </li>
                
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
                
            <li> 1 russet potato, cut into 1/4-inch slices </li>
                
            <li> 1 pinch ground cumin </li>
                
            <li> salt to taste </li>
                
            <li> 3 tablespoons butter, cut into thin slices, or to taste </li>
                
            <li> 1 pinch saffron threads </li>
                
            <li> 1 Â½ tablespoons hot water </li>
                
            <li> 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, or to taste </li>
          </ul>
    <h2> Steps </h2>
          <ol>
            <li> 
              <p> Place water and kosher salt in a pot; bring to a boil.
                  Add rice; cook and stir for </p>
              <p> exactly 7 minutes. Drain. </p>
               </li>
            <li> 
              <p> Heat olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Cover the
                  bottom of the pot with </p>
              <p> 1 layer of potato slices. Sprinkle cumin and salt over
                  potatoes. Cook until </p>
              <p> potatoes are sizzling, 2 to 3 minutes; top potatoes with
                  rice to form an even </p>
              <p> layer. Reduce heat to low and place butter slices over
                  rice. </p>
                </li>
            <li> 
              <p> Top the pot with a layer of clean paper towels, </p>
              <p> then place the lid over the towels. Steam until rice is
                  fluffy, about 45 minutes. </p>
                </li>
            <li> 
              <p> Grind saffron threads with a mortar and pestle. Mix
                  crushed saffron with 1 1/2 </p>
              <p> tablespoons hot water in a large bowl. Add a couple of
                  spoonfuls of rice to </p>
              <p> saffron mixture and stir until rice is yellow. </p>
                </li>
            <li> 
              <p> Spoon remaining rice into a serving bowl. Top with saffron rice and line the </p><p> edges of the bowl with potatoes. Garnish with parsley. </p></li>
